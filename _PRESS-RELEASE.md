There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Predict the likelihood of getting a seat on BART on your way home before heading to the station! ##

## Summary ##
Dog tired from a long day at work? Would you give your first-born child for that seat on BART today? Well, find out whether the train is overcrowded because of events BEFORE you leave your office! Sardine Can uses cutting-edge technology to predict how crowded your BART train or Muni bus will be before ever leaving.

## Problem ##
Need an excuse to have that drink with coworkers before trekking over to the station? We'll do that for you!

Have to decide whether surge pricing on Uber is worth it compared to the Sardine Can that is BART right after a Giants game? We'll help you make that decision!

Want to tell your boss the reason you need to take off from work an hour early? Tell'em Sardine Can wants you to leave early! They'll believe you! They're Sardine Can customers too!

## Solution ##
No matter if it's a special event or a scheduled one, we can provide you peace-of-mind to help you have a better commute to work or back home. Bay Bridge is closed over the weekend for retrofitting? We take that into account. Giants are playing the Dodgers this weekend? We will help you fit that around your schedule. We can even tell you how many stations to go in the opposite direction for you to snag that seat on the Fremont train!

 - Train crowding is predicted based upon events occuring along BART stations. Currently, we predict train crowding based on Giants and A's games. If you trip originates or passes through affected stations, that would constitute an affect trip. If your scheduled trip begins after the 8th inning, this would have an adverse affect on your commute. Scheduled starts also affect station crowding, even if the train you plan to take is going in the opposite direction if you begin or end your trip at the affected stations. Stations affected are Coliseum, Embarcadero and Montgomery stations.

  > The worst part of my day is usually my commute. If I can make the commute just a little bit better for me or my friends, I feel that I've made a dent on this world somehow.
