This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com). This project was a minimum viable product using real time estimates through the [BART API](http://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/api).

You can see the project at [http://bart.warrenwong.org](http://bart.warrenwong.org).
